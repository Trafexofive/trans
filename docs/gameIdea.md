### **Expanded Game Concept: Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe**

The name "Atomic" is fitting, but "Quantum" better captures the new mechanics of uncertainty, manipulation, and strategic depth. This is no longer just Tic-Tac-Toe; it's a battle of board control, resource management, and tactical ability.

#### **I. Pre-Game Lobby: The Modifiers**

Before a match begins, players will select from a series of modifiers that fundamentally alter the rules of engagement. This ensures no two matches feel exactly alike and allows for a wide range of strategic challenges.

1.  **Grid Size (Core Modifier):**
    *   **Description:** Determines the dimensions of the playing field.
    *   **Options:** `3x3` (Classic), `4x4`, `5x5` (Strategic).
    *   **Impact:** Larger grids increase the game's complexity and the importance of long-term planning.

2.  **Win Condition (Connect 'N'):**
    *   **Description:** Sets the number of marks a player must align to win. This is dynamically linked to Grid Size.
    *   **Options:** `3` (for 3x3), `4` (for 4x4 and 5x5), `5` (for 5x5).
    *   **Impact:** Prevents larger boards from ending too quickly and introduces more complex pattern recognition.

3.  **Piece Lifespan (The "Quantum" Setting):**
    *   **Description:** Dictates how many of your own turns a piece remains on the board before decaying.
    *   **Options:** `3` (Standard), `5` (Durable), `Infinite` (Classic Mode).
    *   **Impact:** This is the core strategic lever. A shorter lifespan creates a faster, more aggressive game. `Infinite` disables the primary twist, allowing for a traditional match.

4.  **Power-up Spawning (The "Chaos" Setting):**
    *   **Description:** Toggles the in-game power-up system.
    *   **Options:** `On`, `Off`.
    *   **Impact:** Allows players to choose between a "pure" strategic match based on placement and decay, or a "chaotic" match where game-altering abilities can turn the tide.

5.  **Turn Timer:**
    *   **Description:** Sets a time limit for each player's move.
    *   **Options:** `15 Seconds` (Blitz), `30 Seconds` (Standard), `None`.
    *   **Impact:** Adds time pressure, rewarding quick thinking and punishing indecision.

#### **II. In-Game Mechanic: The Power-up System**

When enabled, this system introduces a new layer of tactical decision-making beyond simple piece placement.

**Acquisition & Usage:**
*   **Spawning:** Every few turns, a power-up icon will randomly appear on an available empty square.
*   **Claiming:** The first player to place their mark on that square claims the power-up. This action also counts as their normal move for the turn.
*   **Banking:** A player can hold only **one** power-up at a time. It is "banked" and can be used on a subsequent turn. Claiming a new power-up while another is banked will overwrite the old one.
*   **Activation:** On their turn, a player has a choice: either place a standard mark OR activate their banked power-up.

**The Power-ups:**

1.  **Overwrite (Offensive):**
    *   **Icon:** A stylized atom or nucleus.
    *   **Effect:** Place your mark on a square already occupied by an opponent, destroying their mark in the process. This move is a direct, aggressive push that can break a defensive line or steal a winning position.

2.  **Reinforce (Defensive):**
    *   **Icon:** A shield.
    *   **Effect:** Target one of your own existing marks on the board and reset its decay timer to its maximum value (e.g., back to 3 or 5). This is the primary tool for preserving a critical offensive or defensive position.

3.  **Barrier (Control):**
    *   **Icon:** A solid wall or forcefield.
    *   **Effect:** Place a neutral, indestructible 'blocker' on any empty square. This blocker cannot be used by either player and has its own decay timer of 2 opponent turns (meaning it disappears after both you and your opponent have each taken two more moves). It is a pure area denial tool used to disrupt opponent plans.

4.  **Displacement (Utility):**
    *   **Icon:** A swap or arrow icon.
    *   **Effect:** Move one of your own existing marks from its current square to any other empty square on the board. Its decay timer is preserved. This allows for surprise relocations, rescuing a key piece from being trapped, or creating an unexpected winning line.
